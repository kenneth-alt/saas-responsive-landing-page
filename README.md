# saas-responsive-landing-page
This is part of my metoring tutorial for younger students on building a professional website.

This project is a static landing page and does not use any frameworks or libraries. It is built with pure HTML and vanilla CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ dropdowns.
