# saas-responsive-landing-page
This is part of my metoring tutorial for younger students on building a professional website.

This project is a static but responsive company landing page adapted for various screen sizes and for mobile, and does not use any frameworks or libraries. It is built with pure HTML and vanilla CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ dropdowns.
